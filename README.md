# Olx Notifier

The application monitors the list of advertisements on the olx.ua website in real-time, and as soon as a new advertisement is created, the user receives a notification about it, enabling them to respond to it immediately. The application can be helpful in apartment hunting, as it allows users to apply search filters and respond to advertisements more quickly than others.

## Demo

To start tracking new advertisements, you need to provide a link to the list of advertisements on the olx.ua website. Then, click the "Start searching" button. Once a new advertisement appears, you will hear an audio notification and a table will appear. Clicking on a table field will redirect you to the advertisement link.
